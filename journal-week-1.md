The term "comfortably uncomfortable" is an understatement at this point for me as an entry level developer. This experience so far has taught and made me to become a detective, not a very good one so far, but am working on it. Although I don't have previous knowledge in computer programming, I do have interest in learning how things work in both technology and in iOS development.

Programing has different languages; therefor I am learning another language just in a different form. So far, it is much harder than speaking Chinese! But thinking back how I learned Chinese and English was to immerse myself in the environment, and go along with the conversations while trying to communicate. One day it will just clicked and eventually things will make more sense! But in TIY environment, there's only 12 weeks for you to be fluent enough and go out there and make it on your own. 

There have been so many difficulties in the past several days; other than the intense learning, time management, busting our heads to figure out a function in a code...etc, we also put a good amount of pressure on ourselves to see this through. I've never thought programing is the creative type of work, but I've come to learn that there are a lot of creativity involved in every detail! Being a programer also means you are constantly learning and evolving to be better and up-to-date. 

One thing I need to improve on is to ask more questions, and not be afraid to look or sound "stupid". I know, it's the fixed mindset talking and I am working on to be better. Coming to week three, I've learned a lot and I know TIY is going to be a special part of my life journey.
